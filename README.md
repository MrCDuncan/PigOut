# Object-Oriented Programming Week 8 Final Class Project Work
This is Pig Out by Chris Duncan 3/6/2020

The following files are requred for execution:
Pig_Out.py


To run, load Pig_Out.PY in your Python interpreter of choice.

Here are the rules of Pig Out - aka Pass The Pig:
Each player is trying to get to a score of 100
A player may roll or pass
Each turn involves one player throwing two model pigs, each of which has a dot on one side. 
The player gains or loses points based on the way the pigs land. 
Each turn lasts until the player throwing either rolls the pigs in a way that wipes out their current score, is one sider with a dot and one with out, or decides to stop their turn.
Sider - The pigs are on their sides, either both with the spot facing upward or both with the spot facing downward - 1 Point
Double Razorback - The pigs are both lying on their backs - 20 Points
Double Trotter - The pigs are both standing upright - 20 Points
Double Snouter - The pigs are both leaning on their snouts - 40 Points
Double Leaning Jowler - The pigs are both resting between snouts and ears - 60 Points
Pig Out - If both pigs are lying on their sides, one with the spot facing upwards and one with the spot facing downwards the score for that player is reset to 0 and the turn changes to the next player
Oinker- If both pigs are touching in any position,[2] then the total score is reset to 0 and the turn changes to the next player
Mixed Combo - A combination not mentioned above is the sum of the single pigs scores
   Razorback - The pig is lying on its back - 5 Points
   Trotter - The pig is standing upright - 5 Points
   Snouter - The pig is leaning on its snout - 10 Points
   Leaning Jowler - The pig is resting on its snout and ear - 15 Points
Good Luck!

Enjoy!
